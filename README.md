## Introduction

In today’s data-driven society, the ability to compare socio-economic indicators across regions is critical for informed decision-making. This dashboard project presents a comparative analysis between France and Latvia, focusing on labor markets, wage trends, employment distribution, and economic activity.

By leveraging storytelling dashboard techniques and modern web development technologies, the platform delivers an intuitive and interactive experience for users to explore key indicators and uncover insights.

## Project Scope

The main objectives of this dashboard are to:

- Provide side-by-side comparisons of socio-economic metrics between France and Latvia.
- Enable data filtering by time periods, sectors, and socio-professional categories.
- Support stakeholders and policymakers in identifying patterns, disparities, and potential policy focus areas.

**Data Sources:**
- INSEE (France)
- Central Statistical Bureau (Latvia)

**Covered Indicators:**
- Average wages
- Employment rates
- Employment distribution by sector
- Value added by economic activity

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Next.js React framework.

## Methodology

This dashboard is built using a storytelling approach, based on research by Lavalle et al. (2025), which ensures that all visualizations align with decision-makers’ mental models.

### Steps:

1. **Requirement Gathering** – Using the i* framework to map goals and analytical needs.
2. **Data Structuring** – Organizing tasks and aligning datasets with analytical flow via tree structures and Knowledge Graphs.
3. **Data Processing** – Using ETL processes to extract, clean, and load data efficiently.
4. **Visualization Design** – Implementing intuitive charts (bar, line, etc.) and interactive filters to enable deeper exploration.

This methodology enhances clarity, supports intuitive navigation, and allows scalability for future analytics (e.g., predictive modeling).
